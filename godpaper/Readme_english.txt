PC 8k intro for Tokyo Demo Fest 2015
by Tomohiro

System requirement
--------
GPU: support OpenGL 4.2 or higher.
(nVidia Geforce400s series or later supports OpenGL 4.2.
If your Geforce/Quadro doesn't support it, you might need to update GPU driver.
Most of DirectX 11 class GPU supports OpenGL 4.2)
This program is only tested in Nvidia GPU, because I have only that GPU.
But I read OpenGL specification and tried to avoid using vender specific functions.
So theoretically, this program runs in any 3D accelerator supports OpenGL 4.

OS: Windows7 or Windows8 (maybe WindowsXP, WindowsVista)
CPU: support x87 FPU
(This program uses only 1 thread)

4k Intro doesn't run!
--------
Most of 4k intro don't check errors in order to make file as small as possible.
*_debug.exe shows same visual and sound and it has error check code and output error messages in console.
